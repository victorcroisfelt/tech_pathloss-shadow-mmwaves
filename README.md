## Abstract
The possibility to use the available spectrum at the millimeter wave (mmWave) range makes it a great candidate to support the performance demands expected for the fifth generation (5G) of wireless communications. However, mmWave channels are dissimilar to the wider-known propagation phenomenology of the centimeter waves (cmWave), making it necessary for a proper physical characterization of such links. Motivated by these facts, this work studies some models of large/medium-scale propagation effects for radios operating at mmWave frequencies. This study is based on measurement campaigns available in the literature. The discussions rely on line-of-sight (LoS) probability, large-scale pathloss (PL), and shadow fading (SF) designs. Specific model parameters for urban macro cellular (UMa) environments at a frequency of 28 GHz are analyzed.
